# Agent Configuration - Sandwich Shop App

## Business Context & Vision

### Project Identity

- **Name**: Fomé — a sandwich pre-order web app
- **Purpose**: A custom application for a local sandwich brand (currently without a physical location). It allows customers to pre-order sandwiches for lunch, while providing the shop with inventory management, smooth payment processing, and tools to organize preparation and delivery to coworking spaces.
- **Core Problem Solved**: Eliminates lunch rush chaos by allowing customers to pre-order sandwiches with guaranteed pickup times, while providing admins with comprehensive order and inventory management
- **Target Users**: coworker customers (ordering interface) and shop staff/owners (admin dashboard)

### Strategic Direction

- **Vision Statement**: Support a sandwich business in Lisbon by optimizing logistics, ordering, and payments to deliver quality sandwiches at competitive prices with minimal operational overhead. Starting with a coworking space pilot, scaling to multiple locations if successful, and expanding offerings beyond sandwiches.
- **Key Success Metrics**: Primary - operational efficiency with smoothest purchase experience (best UX, no bugs). Secondary - zero leftovers per drop (starting with 24-sandwich batches, targeting ~100 daily customers at pilot location).
- **Core Principles**: Keep things simple and maintainable - prefer straightforward implementations over sophisticated features. Focus on clear, readable code that's easy to understand and modify. Avoid over-engineering and focus on real problems we actually face.

### Key Decisions & Constraints

- **Technology Choices**:
  - Next.js 15.4.5 with App Router for modern React SSR/SSG capabilities
  - Supabase for PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time features
  - TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
  - Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI for rapid, consistent styling
  - Stripe for payment processing with webhook integration
  - Vercel for deployment with optimized Next.js hosting
- **Design Decisions**:
  - Mobile-first responsive design (max-width: 480px for main layout)
  - Drop-based inventory system instead of daily inventory for flexibility
  - Component-driven architecture with clear separation (ui/, shared/, customer/, admin/)
  - API-first approach with dedicated route handlers
  - Real-time inventory validation to prevent overselling
- **Current Constraints**: No time pressure or budget constraints. Prefer simple solutions - technical complexity must be justified by clear business value. Requires AI intervention when over-complicating solutions.

### Development Patterns

- **Code Style**:
  - TypeScript with strict mode enabled
  - ESLint with Next.js and TypeScript rules
  - Prettier for consistent formatting
  - Arrow functions preferred for components
  - Interface definitions for component props
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - PascalCase for components and interfaces
  - camelCase for functions and variables
  - kebab-case for file/directory names
  - Descriptive component names (e.g., `StickyBasketButton`, `CreateDropModal`)
- **File Organization**:
  - Feature-based organization (customer/, admin/, shared/)
  - Co-located related files (components + types)
  - Index files for clean imports
  - Separate UI components from business logic
- **Testing Approach**:
  - Manual integration testing with custom scripts
  - Stripe payment flow testing with test cards
  - No formal unit testing framework detected (manual testing via browser and scripts)

## Operational Guidelines

### Code Standards & Quality

- **Style Guide**:
  - ESLint configuration extends Next.js core web vitals and TypeScript rules
  - Prettier with default configuration
  - TypeScript strict mode enabled
  - Component interfaces required for all props
- **Code Review Criteria**: Trust AI judgment for technical quality standards. Maintain TypeScript strict mode, existing component interface patterns, and established codebase conventions. Prioritize project goals over perfect code structure.
- **Documentation Level**: High-level function/component documentation. Update comprehensive guides for significant changes, maintaining human-readable friendly format.
- **Agent Document Maintenance**: **CRITICAL** - The agent must regularly update this Agent.md document whenever making changes to the codebase to ensure it accurately reflects the current state of the project. This includes updating technology versions, architectural patterns, component organization, business logic changes, and any new development practices or constraints discovered during work.
- **Testing Requirements**: Continue current manual testing approach with custom scripts for critical flows (e.g., payment testing). No formal automated testing framework needed at this time.

### Development Workflow

- **Git Strategy**: Main branch development (detected from git status)
- **Commit Style**: AI should auto-commit work after completing relevant pieces when supported by AI capabilities
- **File Modification Approach**: AI can modify files directly after receiving permission. Rely on git for version control - AI should auto-commit work after completing relevant pieces of work (when supported by AI capabilities).
- **Backup & Safety**:
  - Supabase CLI with local/remote synchronization
  - Docker-based local development environment
  - Environment variable management for sensitive data

### Collaboration Protocols

- **Approval Requirements**: Always explain approach first and ask explicit permission before implementing any changes. Small bug fixes and cleanup can proceed after approval, larger changes require step-by-step review.
- **Explanation Depth**: Detailed technical explanations with clear reasoning behind all suggestions and changes.
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Provide honest assessment of what's actually needed vs. what might seem cool. Actively warn against over-engineering solutions.

## Context & Knowledge Base

### Project-Specific Knowledge

- **Domain Concepts**:
  - Drop-based inventory system for production control and scarcity creation (2 drops per week initially, announced in advance)
  - Manual drop closure control - no automatic cutoffs
  - Expected ordering pattern: customers order morning of delivery while production happens
  - No cancellation system initially (exceptions handled manually via Stripe dashboard)
  - Order lifecycle management (pending → confirmed → completed)
  - Real-time inventory validation and reservation
  - Admin dashboard for comprehensive business management
- **Integration Points**:
  - Supabase: Database, authentication, real-time subscriptions, file storage
  - Stripe: Payment processing, webhooks for order confirmation
  - Resend: Transactional email delivery (order confirmations, admin notifications)
  - Vercel: Hosting and deployment with Next.js optimizations
  - Docker: Local development environment for Supabase services
- **Performance Considerations**: Speed is important but not critical - avoid 5+ second delays for basic actions like reading menu, but up to 1 minute loading delay is acceptable for complex operations.
- **Technical Debt**:
  - Next.js build warnings ignored (eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds: true) - fix gradually when touching related code, prioritize critical issues
  - TypeScript build errors ignored (typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true) - fix gradually when touching related code, prioritize critical issues
  - Some backup files present (.tsx.backup files)

### Learning & Memory

- **Session Continuity**: Learn from conversations and adjust approach. Remember business context, user preferences, and established patterns across interactions.
- **Decision History**:
  - Migrated to drop-based system from daily inventory for better flexibility
  - Chose Supabase over traditional SQL for real-time capabilities
  - Implemented Stripe for payment processing with webhook validation
  - Selected Shadcn/UI for consistent, accessible component library
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify user preferences for simplicity, detect over-engineering tendencies, recognize business priorities over technical perfection.

## Boundaries & Constraints

### Security Guidelines

- **Sensitive Data**: Never access or modify environment variables, API keys, or customer personal data
- **File Access**: AI can access all files but requires explicit approval before any modifications
- **External Requests**:
  - **Pre-Production (Current)**: Standard approval process for all external service changes
  - **Production (Update when v1 launches)**: Extra caution required for Stripe payment flows, database migrations, and webhook handlers due to revenue/data risks

### Operational Limits

- **Change Scope**: AI can handle small bug fixes and code cleanup autonomously after approval. Larger changes require step-by-step approach with review at each phase.
- **Complexity Threshold**: Always divide complex features into tasks. Break down all work so user can: 1) review strategy, plan and approach, 2) follow step by step implementation.
- **Quality Gates**:
  - TypeScript compilation must pass
  - Components must follow existing interface patterns
  - Database changes require migration files
  - Payment flows must maintain Stripe webhook integrity
