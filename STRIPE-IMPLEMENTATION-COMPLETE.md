## 🔄 Updated Flow

### Before (Cash/MBWay)

```
Cart → Checkout Form → Order Created (Pending) → Cash at Pickup
```

### After (Stripe)

```
Cart → Checkout Form → [Continue to Payment] → Stripe Payment → Order Created (confirmed) → Pickup
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema Changes Required

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Run these SQL commands in your Supabase dashboard:**

```sql
-- Add payment fields to orders table
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN payment_intent_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN payment_method TEXT;

-- Update status enum to use new naming
ALTER TABLE orders DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS orders_status_check;
ALTER TABLE orders ADD CONSTRAINT orders_status_check
  CHECK (status IN ('confirmed', 'delivered'));

-- Update default status for new orders
ALTER TABLE orders ALTER COLUMN status SET DEFAULT 'confirmed';
```

## 🌐 Environment Variables

Add these to your production environment (Vercel):

```bash
# Stripe Configuration (Use LIVE keys for production)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_live_stripe_secret_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_live_stripe_publishable_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_live_webhook_secret_here

# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Development Testing

```bash
# Run the automated test script
node test-payment-flow.js
```

### Manual Testing with Stripe Test Cards
