---

## 🎯 **Remaining Testing Priorities**

### **1. Customer Experience Testing (Priority: HIGH)**

#### **Home Page & Menu Display**
- [x] **Drop Filtering**: Verify only upcoming/active drops shown
- [x] **Deadline Countdown**: Test real-time countdown display
- [x] **Status Messages**: Clear messaging for different states
- [x] **Order Blocking**: Can't order from completed drops

#### **Cart & Checkout Flow**
- [x] **Cart Validation**: Items validated against drop status
- [x] **Deadline Warnings**: Clear messaging about order deadlines
- [x] **Graceful Degradation**: Handle drop status changes during checkout
- [x] **Order Confirmation**: Pickup time and deadline information

#### **Test Scenarios to Run**
1. **Normal Order Flow**: Browse → Add to Cart → Checkout → Confirm
2. **Deadline Expiry**: Cart becomes invalid after deadline
3. **Status Changes**: Drop completes while user has items in cart
4. **Reopened Drops**: Can order from reopened drops normally

### **2. Edge Case Testing (Priority: HIGH)**

#### **Timing Edge Cases**
- [ ] **Order at Deadline**: Order placed right before cutoff
- [ ] **Status Race Conditions**: Admin changes status while auto-completion runs
- [ ] **Timezone Handling**: Deadline calculations across different timezones
- [ ] **Date Boundaries**: Orders around midnight/date changes

#### **Business Logic Edge Cases**
- [ ] **Extended Hours**: Admin extends pickup time after deadline
- [ ] **Emergency Closures**: Quick status changes for unexpected events
- [ ] **Partial Completion**: Some orders completed, others pending
- [ ] **Inventory Conflicts**: Stock changes during active ordering

### **3. Mobile Experience Testing (Priority: MEDIUM)**

#### **Mobile-Specific Tests**
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Admin interface works on mobile
- [ ] **Touch Interactions**: Status changes work on touch devices
- [ ] **Mobile Navigation**: Easy navigation between admin sections
- [ ] **Mobile Performance**: Fast loading on mobile devices

## 🧪 **Testing Methodology**

### **Manual Testing Approach**
1. **Admin Workflow Testing**: Complete drop management cycle
2. **Customer Workflow Testing**: Complete ordering cycle
3. **Edge Case Simulation**: Test timing and status change scenarios
4. **Mobile Testing**: Test on various mobile devices

### **Test Data Setup**
- **Test Drop**: August 17th (already completed for testing)
- **Active Drop**: August 18th (currently active)
- **Upcoming Drop**: August 21st (future drop)
- **Past Drops**: August 14th and 17th (completed)

---

## 🚀 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Today (Day 1 of Week 4)**
1. **Customer Experience Testing**: Test home page, cart, checkout
2. **Edge Case Testing**: Test timing scenarios and status changes
3. **Document Issues**: Log any problems found

### **Tomorrow (Day 2 of Week 4)**
1. **Mobile Testing**: Test admin interface on mobile devices
2. **Performance Optimization**: Identify and fix any slow operations
3. **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and edge cases

### **Day 3-4 of Week 4**
1. **Integration Testing**: Test complete workflows end-to-end
2. **User Acceptance Testing**: Test with actual admin users
3. **Documentation Updates**: Update user guides and technical docs

## 📋 **Testing Checklist for Today**

### **Customer Experience (Test as Customer)**
- [ ] Visit home page - verify only upcoming/active drops shown
- [ ] Add items to cart from active drop
- [ ] Proceed to checkout
- [ ] Complete order
- [ ] Verify order confirmation
- [ ] Test cart validation with completed drops

### **Admin Experience (Test as Admin)**
- [ ] Login to admin dashboard
- [ ] View upcoming vs past drops tables
- [ ] Change drop status (upcoming → active → completed)
- [ ] Reopen completed drop (completed → active)
- [ ] Verify status change logging
- [ ] Test deadline management

### **Edge Cases (Test Both Roles)**
- [ ] Order right before deadline
- [ ] Change drop status during active ordering
- [ ] Test with multiple browser tabs
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test error scenarios

---

## 🔍 **Specific Issues to Investigate**

### **1. Future Completed Drops**
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Manual admin override for testing
- **Action**: No action needed, system working as designed

### **2. API Endpoint Testing**
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Endpoints working correctly
- **Action**: Update test script to use correct localhost:3001 port

### **3. Performance Optimization**
- **Status**: ✅ EXCELLENT - All functions <100ms
- **Action**: Monitor for any degradation under load

---

## 📝 **Success Criteria for Today**

- [ ] Customer ordering flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Admin can manage all drop statuses
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Mobile experience acceptable
- [ ] No critical errors or crashes
- [ ] All test scenarios pass

---

## 🚨 **Risk Areas to Monitor**

### **High Risk**
- **Cart Validation**: Ensure cart doesn't break with status changes
- **Deadline Logic**: Verify timing calculations are accurate
- **Status Transitions**: Prevent invalid status changes

### **Medium Risk**
- **Mobile Experience**: Ensure admin interface works on mobile
- **Performance**: Monitor for any slowdowns
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for edge cases

### **Low Risk**
- **Database Functions**: Already proven to work
- **API Endpoints**: Already tested and working
- **Admin Interface**: Core functionality working
