# üöÄ Production Deployment Guide

## üìã Overview

This guide walks you through deploying your sandwich shop app from local development (with local Supabase) to production, with special attention to Stripe payment configuration and database management.

**Your Current Setup:**

- ‚úÖ Local Supabase environment for development
- ‚úÖ Stripe integration with webhook-based order creation
- ‚úÖ All features working locally with test payments

**Production Goals:**

- üéØ Deploy to production with remote Supabase
- üéØ Configure Stripe for production (test mode first, then live)
- üéØ Ensure webhooks work properly in production
- üéØ Maintain data integrity during deployment

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Production Database Setup

#### Step 1.1: Verify Your Existing Production Setup

‚úÖ **You already have this set up!** Your production Supabase project `fome-sandwich-shop` is linked and ready.

```bash
# Verify your current setup
npx supabase projects list
# Should show: ‚óè fome-sandwich-shop (linked)

# Check your current migrations
npx supabase migration list
```

#### Step 1.2: Deploy Your Schema to Production

```bash
# Push your local migrations to your linked production project
npx supabase db push

# Verify schema was deployed correctly
npx supabase db diff --linked
```

**What this does:**

- Applies all your local migrations (including Stripe payment tables) to production
- Updates your production database with the latest schema
- No data loss - only adds new tables/columns

#### Step 1.3: Get Your Production Supabase Credentials

```bash
# Get your production API keys
npx supabase projects api-keys --project-ref tutzpfqwiqhlpletexjg
```

#### Step 1.4: Update Vercel Environment Variables

In your Vercel dashboard (Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables):

```bash
# Production Supabase (replace local URLs with production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://tutzpfqwiqhlpletexjg.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key_from_above_command
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_production_service_role_key_from_above_command

# App Configuration (update for production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOP_NAME="Fom√© Sandwich Shop"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOP_EMAIL=orders@yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOP_PHONE="+351123456789"

# Admin Configuration
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com

# Email Service (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key_here

# Stripe Configuration (START WITH TEST KEYS)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_test_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_test_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_production_webhook_secret
```

## üí≥ Stripe Production Configuration

### Phase 2A: Production with Stripe Test Mode (RECOMMENDED FIRST)

**Why start with test mode in production?**

- Test the complete production flow without real money
- Verify webhooks work correctly in production environment
- Catch any environment-specific issues safely
- Build confidence before going live

#### Step 2A.1: Configure Stripe Test Webhooks for Production

1. **Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks)**
2. **Add endpoint**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. **Select events**:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. **Copy webhook signing secret** ‚Üí Add to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in production env

#### Step 2A.2: Test Production Flow with Test Cards

```bash
# Test cards (these work in production with test keys)
Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002
Insufficient funds: 4000 0000 0000 9995
```

**Testing Checklist:**

- [ ] Place test order in production
- [ ] Verify payment processes correctly
- [ ] Check webhook receives events
- [ ] Confirm order created in production database
- [ ] Verify confirmation email sent
- [ ] Test admin panel shows new order
- [ ] Test order status updates work

### Phase 2B: Go Live with Real Payments

**‚ö†Ô∏è Only proceed after Phase 2A is 100% working!**

#### Step 2B.1: Stripe Account Verification

1. **Complete business verification** in Stripe Dashboard
2. **Add bank account** for payouts
3. **Set up tax information** if required
4. **Enable live mode** in Stripe Dashboard

#### Step 2B.2: Switch to Live Keys

**In your production environment variables:**

```bash
# Replace test keys with live keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_stripe_live_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_stripe_live_publishable_key
```

#### Step 2B.3: Configure Live Webhooks

1. **Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)** (live mode)
2. **Add endpoint**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. **Select same events**: `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. **Update webhook secret** in production environment

#### Step 2B.4: Go-Live Testing

**Start small and monitor closely:**

1. **Process a small real transaction** (‚Ç¨1-2 if possible)
2. **Monitor Stripe Dashboard** for successful processing
3. **Check production database** for order creation
4. **Verify email notifications** work
5. **Test refund process** through Stripe Dashboard
6. **Monitor for 24-48 hours** before announcing

## üîß Production Deployment Steps

### Phase 3: Deploy Application

#### Step 3.1: Pre-Deployment Checklist

```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build

# Check for any build errors
npm run lint

# Verify all environment variables are set
# (Use your hosting platform's environment variable interface)
```

#### Step 3.2: Deploy to Production

**For Vercel (recommended):**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod

# Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
# Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
```

**For other platforms:**

- Netlify: Connect GitHub repo, set env vars in site settings
- Railway: Connect repo, add env vars in project settings
- DigitalOcean App Platform: Use App Spec with env vars

#### Step 3.3: Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Test your production URL
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/health

# Should return: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","message":"Webhook endpoint is accessible"}
```

## üîÑ Data Migration Strategy

### If You Have Important Local Data

**Option 1: Fresh Start (Recommended)**

- Start with clean production database
- Use seed data for initial products/locations
- Begin taking real orders in production

**Option 2: Migrate Specific Data**

```sql
-- Export important data from local Supabase
-- (Run these in your local Supabase Studio SQL editor)

-- Export locations
SELECT * FROM locations;

-- Export products
SELECT * FROM products;

-- Export any important configuration data
```

Then manually insert this data into production via Supabase Studio.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Don't migrate:**

- Test orders
- Test customers
- Development admin users

## üö® Troubleshooting Production Issues

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Webhooks Not Working in Production

**Symptoms:**

- Payments succeed but orders not created
- No webhook events in Stripe Dashboard

**Solutions:**

1. **Check webhook URL**: Must be `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
2. **Verify webhook secret**: Must match production environment variable
3. **Check Stripe Dashboard**: Look for failed webhook deliveries
4. **Test webhook endpoint**: `curl https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/health`

#### Issue: Database Connection Errors

**Symptoms:**

- 500 errors on API calls
- "Connection refused" in logs

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Supabase URLs**: Check production project settings
2. **Check API keys**: Ensure anon key and service role key are correct
3. **Test connection**: Use Supabase Studio to verify database is accessible

#### Issue: Email Notifications Not Sending

**Symptoms:**

- Orders created but no confirmation emails
- Admin not receiving failure notifications

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Resend API key**: Verify it's set in production environment
2. **Verify email domains**: Ensure sending domain is configured in Resend
3. **Check email templates**: Ensure they exist in production build
